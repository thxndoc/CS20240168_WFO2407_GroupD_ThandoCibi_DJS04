## DJS04 Project Brief: Book Connect - Web Components
Transform the book preview functionality of the "Book Connect" application into a fully operational Web Component. Additionally, evaluate and potentially convert other parts of the application into Web Components to enhance modularity and reusability.
#### Goals
- **Convert Book Preview to Web Component:** The main focus is to encapsulate the book preview feature into a Web Component, making it reusable and independent.
- **Assess Other Components:** Identify other elements within the "Book Connect" app that could benefit from being converted into Web Components.
- **Maintain Functionality:** Ensure that the application retains all its current functionalities after refactoring.
#### Tasks
1. **Understand the Existing Codebase:** Familiarise yourself with the current structure and functionality of the "Book Connect" project, focusing on the book preview feature.
2. **Create a Web Component for Book Preview:**
   - Encapsulate the book preview into a Web Component.
   - Ensure that the component is self-contained, with its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Test the component to ensure it works seamlessly within the app.
3. **Identify and Convert Other Components:**
   - Analyse the application to identify other potential components for conversion.
   - Prioritise components based on their reusability and importance to the app.
   - Convert the chosen elements into Web Components.
4. **Testing and Integration:**
   - Rigorously test the new components individually and within the context of the application.
   - Pay special attention to interactions between components and the overall user experience.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Document the process of creating the Web Components.
   - Include any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
   - Provide a clear guide on how the components should be used within the app.
#### Discussion and Reflection
Prepare to discuss your experience with your coach, focusing on:
- Challenges encountered while converting the book preview and other elements into Web Components.
- The rationale behind selecting certain elements for conversion into Web Components.
- Insights gained about the advantages and limitations of using Web Components in web development.
#### Submission Guidelines
Submit your updated "Book Connect" codebase, including all the newly created Web Components. Ensure your code is well-commented and adheres to best practices for Web Component development. Include a detailed report covering your process, challenges, and reflections on working with Web Components.
Make sure to submit your project to the LMS on the DJS04 Project Tab.
